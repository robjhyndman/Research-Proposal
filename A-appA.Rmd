# Metric distributions across Census years
The figure below shows violin plots for four variables across Census years, providing a snapshot of the variables recorded for each year.

# Transformation methods for logratio analysis

### Additive Logratio
Maps to $\mathbb{R}^{D} \text{ for } {\bf v}_i \to {\bf w}_i$

$$\text{alr}(v_{ij}) = w_{ij} = \text{ln}(v_{ij}/v_{iD}), \space \forall \space j \in \{1,...,D\}$$

$$\text{alr}({\bf v}_i) = (\frac{\text{ln}(v_{i1})}{\text{ln}(v_{iD})}, ..., \frac{\text{ln}(v_{i(D-1)})}{\text{ln}(v_{iD})}, 1) = \text{ln}({\bf v}_i)\space \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & ... & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & ... & 0 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    0 & 0 & ... & 1 \\
    -1 & -1 & ... & -1
\end{bmatrix}$$

Transform back to $\textbf{v}_i$ using: $\textbf{v}_i = \exp(\textbf{w}_i) \cdot v_{iD}$


### Centred Logratio
Maps to $\mathbb{R}^{D} \text{ for } {\bf v}_i \to {\bf w}_i$. Let $g({\bf v_i}) = \sqrt[D]{\prod_{j=1}^D v_{ij}}$.

$$\text{clr}(v_{ij}) = w_{ij} = \text{ln}(\frac{v_{ij}}{g({\bf v_i})}), \forall \space j \in \{1,...,D\}$$

$$\text{clr}({\bf v}_i) = \Big(\text{ln}(\frac{v_{i1}}{g({\bf v_i})}),...,\text{ln}(\frac{v_{iD}}{g({\bf v_i})}))\Big) \\ = \frac{\text{ln}({\bf x}_i)}{D} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
    D-1 & -1 & ... & -1 \\
    -1 & D-1 & ... & -1 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    -1 & -1 & ... & D-1
\end{bmatrix}$$

Transform back to $\textbf{v}_i$ using: $v_{ij} = \frac{\exp(w_{ij})}{\sum_{j=1}^D \exp(w_{ij})}$


### Isometric Logratio
Maps to $\mathbb{R}^{D-1} \text{ for } {\bf v}_i \to {\bf w}_i$.

$$\text{ilr}_M({\bf v}_i) = clr({\bf v}_i)\cdot{\bf M} = \text{ln}({\bf v}_i) \cdot {\bf M}$$

Where $\bf M$ is a matrix of $D$ rows and $D-1$ columns such that ${\bf M} \cdot {\bf M}^t = {\bf I}_{D-1}$. ${\bf I}_{D-1}$ is the identity matrix of $D-1$ elements.

Transform back to $\bf{v}_i$ as: ${\bf v}_i = \exp({\bf w}_i \space \cdot \space {\bf M^{-1}})$
